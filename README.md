#Smoking Hot Data

<hr/>

### Repo Collaborators

This repository houses the work of Anthony Alvarez, Daniel Evans, Sonia Kingslien, and Ly-Bach Truong.

### Technologies Used
The group utilizes several Python/Javascript libraries, such as PyMongo, pandas, Flask, D3, and React.js to import data from several CSV files into a NoSQL database (MongoDB) and serves the data to the end user through the utilization of RESTful APIs.

### Web Application Info
We use smoking data that are stored in several csv files to create the data visualizations. The web app pulls data from a MongoDB database and pushes out the data in JSON format as API endpoints.

Afterwards, the JS script collects the data from those endpoints to create the visualizations.

Clients can view the visualizations on the index page of the web app.
