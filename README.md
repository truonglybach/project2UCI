# project2UCI: Smoking Hot Data

This repository houses the work of Anthony Alvarez, Daniel Evans, Sonia Kingslien, and Ly-Bach Truong.

The group utilizes several Python/Javascript libraries, such as PyMongo, pandas, Flask, D3, and React.js to import data from several CSV files into a NoSQL database (MongoDB) and serves the data to the end user through the utilization of RESTful APIs.

Clients can view our visualizations of the data on the index page of the web app.
